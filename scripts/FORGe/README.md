# FORGe prioritization scripts
This folder contains the scripts used to select the variants using the FORGe workflow.
Instruction on how to apply the analyses can be found at the [FORGe github page](https://github.com/langmead-lab/FORGe).
For this paper, we used the hybrid method and selected the top 10% prioritized variants.
